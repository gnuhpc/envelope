 * An Envelope component is a class that can insert functionality into an Envelope pipeline, such
 * as an input, or a deriver, or a task.
 * Envelope exposes interface APIs for components to be implemented with. Those interfaces will
 * extend this Component interface.
 * Envelope provides some built-in components. Pipelines can also provide their own plugins
 * that implement the corresponding component APIs.

Envelope provides the ability for a pipeline to make a decision that will determine which steps will be run. This is achieved by including a decision step that, when itself is run, decides which subsequent steps of the pipeline to remove and which ones to keep.

A decision step makes a decision that returns a true or false result. The `if-true-steps` configuration of a decision step specifies which of its dependent steps will be kept if the result is true. The remaining dependent steps will be kept if the result is false.

A decision step can make a decision using one of three methods, which are outlined with examples in the section below.

== Decision methods

=== Literal

The `literal` decision method takes the true or false result directly from the configuration of the decision step. This method would be useful if the result is provided by a parameter, which in turn can be populated by a `spark-submit` argument or an environment variable.

In this self-contained example the value of the `${result}` parameter will determine whether `run_if_true` and `run_after_run_if_true`, or `run_if_false` and `run_after_run_if_false`, are run:

----
application.name = Decision step by literal
steps {
  decide {
    type = decision
    if-true-steps = [run_if_true]
    method = literal
    result = ${result}
  }
  run_if_true {
    dependencies = [decide]
    deriver {
      type = sql
      query.literal = "SELECT true"
    }
    print.data.enabled = true
  }
  run_after_run_if_true {
    dependencies = [run_if_true]
    deriver {
      type = sql
      query.literal = "SELECT 'No, really, it was true!'"
    }
    print.data.enabled = true
  }
  run_if_false {
    dependencies = [decide]
    deriver {
      type = sql
      query.literal = "SELECT false"
    }
    print.data.enabled = true
  }
  run_after_run_if_false {
    dependencies = [run_if_false]
    deriver {
      type = sql
      query.literal = "SELECT 'No, really, it was false!'"
    }
    print.data.enabled = true
  }
}
----

This pipeline could be run with `${result}` populated by using an argument after the configuration file:

  spark-submit envelope-*.jar pipeline.conf result=true

NOTE: CDH5 uses `spark2-submit` instead of `spark-submit` for Spark 2 applications such as Envelope.

=== Step by key

The `step_by_key` decision method takes the result from the data of a previous step, where the result is looked up in that data by a specific key. This method would be useful for making decisions on data quality results that provide a true or false result for each dataset-scoped check.

The data of the step must contain only two columns: first a string (the key), and second a boolean (the result).

In this self-contained example the corresponding value of the `test1` key in the `generate` step will determine whether `run_if_true` and `run_after_run_if_true`, or `run_if_false` and `run_after_run_if_false`, are run:

----
application.name = Decision step by step by key
steps {
  generate {
    deriver {
      type = sql
      query.literal = "SELECT 'test1', true UNION ALL SELECT 'test2', false"
    }
  }
  decide {
    dependencies = [generate]
    type = decision
    if-true-steps = [run_if_true]
    method = step_by_key
    step = generate
    key = test1
  }
  run_if_true {
    dependencies = [decide]
    deriver {
      type = sql
      query.literal = "SELECT true"
    }
    print.data.enabled = true
  }
  run_after_true {
    dependencies = [run_if_true]
    deriver {
      type = sql
      query.literal = "SELECT 'No, really, it was true!'"
    }
    print.data.enabled = true
  }
  run_if_false {
    dependencies = [decide]
    deriver {
      type = sql
      query.literal = "SELECT false"
    }
    print.data.enabled = true
  }
  run_after_false {
    dependencies = [run_if_false]
    deriver {
      type = sql
      query.literal = "SELECT 'No, really, it was false!'"
    }
    print.data.enabled = true
  }
}
----

=== Step by value

The `step_by_value` decision method takes the result from the single boolean value of a previous step. This method would be useful when a previous step has a deriver that aggregates into a single result.

The data of the step must contain a single boolean column and only a single row.

In this self-contained example the sole value of `aggregate` step will determine whether `run_if_true` and `run_after_run_if_true`, or `run_if_false` and `run_after_run_if_false`, are run:

----
application.name = Decision step by step by value
steps {
  generate {
    deriver {
      type = sql
      query.literal = "SELECT 'test1' AS key, true AS result UNION ALL SELECT 'test2' AS key, false AS result"
    }
  }
  aggregate {
    deriver {
      type = sql
      query.literal = "SELECT MIN(result) = true AS result FROM generate"
    }
  }
  decide {
    dependencies = [aggregate]
    type = decision
    if.true.steps = [run_if_true]
    decision.method = step_by_key
    step = generate
    key = test1
  }
  run_if_true {
    dependencies = [decide]
    deriver {
      type = sql
      query.literal = "SELECT true"
    }
    print.data.enabled = true
  }
  run_after_true {
    dependencies = [run_if_true]
    deriver {
      type = sql
      query.literal = "SELECT 'No, really, it was true!'"
    }
    print.data.enabled = true
  }
  run_if_false {
    dependencies = [decide]
    deriver {
      type = sql
      query.literal = "SELECT false"
    }
    print.data.enabled = true
  }
  run_after_false {
    dependencies = [run_if_false]
    deriver {
      type = sql
      query.literal = "SELECT 'No, really, it was false!'"
    }
    print.data.enabled = true
  }
}
